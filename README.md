vim-config
==========

VIM is my favorite text editor. In this repository I maintain the configuration files to make it work for me on Linux and Windows. I mostly run it in GUI mode (GVim).

Installation
------------

1. Run `git clone https://github.com/ymx/vim-config.git`

2. Copy `.vim`, `.gvimrc` and `.vimrc` to your `$HOME` directory (Linux) or `%UserProfile%` directory (Windows).

3. After starting VIM for the first time, run the `:BundleInstall` command to install the required plugins.
