vim-config
==========

VIM is my favorite text editor. In this repository I maintain the configuration files to make it work for me on Linux and Windows. I mostly run it in GUI mode (GVim).

After starting VIM for the first time, run the following command to install the configured plugins:
```vim
:BundelInstall
```
