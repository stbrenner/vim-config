vim-config
==========

VIM is my favorite text editor. In this repository I maintain the configuration files to make it work for me on Linux and Windows. I mostly run it in GUI mode (GVim).

Installation
------------

Copy the files and directories in this repository to your `$HOME` directory (Linux) or `%UserProfile%` directory (Windows).

After starting VIM for the first time, run the following command to install the configured plugins:
```vim
:BundleInstall
```
